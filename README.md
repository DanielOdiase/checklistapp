### Why use a severless architecture
The decision to use a severless architecture was based on a few reasons .
1. I wanted to get this project out as quick as possible 
2. This makes it easy for my application to scale when needed 



### Overview
Working as a project manager , i noticed i needed some sort of task management platform to keep track of my daily estimates and projects .I needed something small and most importantly free and super simple. Im also a big crypto and basketball guy , so i included both interest in my app by connecting to the coingecko api as well as the NBA API  in order to keep track of my favorite cryptos and basketball games. Hence the Checklist app was born. 
It's a super simple CRUD app that allows its users to add tasks and change the state from :Estimate,Sent Estimates,Won Projects,Ongoing projects.The Checklist app also includes user authentiction that allows users to sign up for the app. With the version2 , users are able to add a profile picture. Also each user can only access and view thier own posts.

The first step in this process is the login. This is done through the login screen, that also allows sign up if the user does not already have an account.
