### Why use a severless architecture
The decision to use a severless architecture was based on a few reasons .
1. I wanted to get this project out as quick as possible 
2. This makes it easy for my application to scale when needed 




### Overview
Working as a project manager , i noticed i needed some sort of task management platform to keep track of my daily estimates , projects i've won and my ongoing projects.I needed something small and most importantly free and super simple. This pushed me to create the Checklist app. 
It's a super simple CRUD app that allows its users to add tasks and change the state from :Estimate,Sent Estimates,Won Projects,Ongoing projects .Once the project is complete, user can delete the task. The Checklist app also includes user authentiction that allows users to sign up for the app. 

The first step in this process is the login. This is done through the login screen, that also allows immediate sign up if the user does not already have an account.

After validating your credentials, the next step is the main dashboard that displays current tasks and thier stages . This is the screen that will allow users to create taks, change task state and delete tasks.
